Testing GitHub with hello-world sample guide

Hello Coders, All,

I'm interested in web development and got registered at freeCodeCamp and created account on gitHub to test/learn how gitHub (git) works. Created this repo to familarize myself with gitHub features.

Hope to join pro coders soon.

Cheers,
